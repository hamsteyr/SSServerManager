# SSServerManager
Insurgency Sandstorm Server Manager

Just a little something that I made in my spare time.

I play a lot of SS and run my own private server, been using bat files all this time until things got a bit complicated and annoying having to change files back and forth and manually add stuff in etc, and so I tried to simplify the process a lot by making this app.

Features:-

No more command line stuff!

Select Mutators easily!

Add Mods and only Enable/ Disable them as you need!

Automatically generate Map Cycles based on the scenario you're playing!

Easy to use interface! (at least I think so)
